            <p id="quote">“I have to believe in a world outside my own mind. 
            I have to believe that my actions still have meaning, even if I can’t remember them. 
            I have to believe that when my eyes are closed, the world’s still there.  
            Do I believe the world’s still there? 
            Is it still out there? Yeah. We all need mirrors to remind ourselves who we are. I’m no different.”  <br><br>
