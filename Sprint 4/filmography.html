                        Pulp fiction neo noir crime story about a writer, The Young Man, who follows strangers for writing material in the broad day light or into the darkness of London.
                        He eventually gets caught by Cobb, a mad thief who toys with others properties. Cobb lures The Young Man also known as Bill/Danny Lloyd into his secret life of theft.
                        Bill comes across a story from one of his trespasses, Lucy Russel.
                        Lucy unveils her shadowy path when she confesses a crime she witnessed from an elder psychotic boyfriend.
                        She had witnessed a murder from a violent criminal who plunged a debtor to death by his own hammer.
                        The story continues as Bill acts out in the underground crime world of murder theft and adultery and continues his own storyline for the future of his storytelling career.

                        In Nightmute, Alaska, seventeen year old resident Kay Connell is found murdered.
                        As a favor to the local Nightmute police chief, two Los Angeles Robbery Homicide police detectives, Will Dormer and Hap Eckhart, are called in to assist in the investigation.
                        Both Dormer and Eckhart are facing some professional issues back in Los Angeles.
                        In Nightmute, Dormer has a major case of insomnia due to a combination of the incessant midnight sun and from a secret he is carrying.
                        This insomnia is causing him to be delusional. Something he is not dreaming about is that the murderer has contacted him, informing him all about the murder and the fact that he knows everything that is going on with Dormer.

                        Cobb's ability has made him a coveted player in this new world of corporate espionage, but it has also made him an international fugitive and cost him everything he has ever loved.
                        Now Cobb is being offered a chance at redemption. One last job could give him his life back but only if he can accomplish the impossible, inception.
                        Instead of the perfect heist, Cobb and his team have to pull off the reverse: their task is to plant an idea.

                        Earth's future has been riddled by disasters, famines, and droughts.
                        There is only one way to ensure mankind's survival: Interstellar travel.
                        A newly discovered wormhole in the far reaches of our solar system allows a team of astronauts to go where no man has gone before, a planet that may have the right environment to sustain human life.

                        May/June 1940. Four hundred thousand British and French soldiers are holed up in the French port town of Dunkirk.
                        The only way out is via sea, and the Germans have air superiority, bombing the British soldiers and ships without much opposition.
                        The situation looks dire and Britain sends civilian boats in addition to its hard-pressed Navy to try to evacuate the beleaguered forces.
                        This is a story seen through the eyes of a soldier amongst those trapped forces, two Royal Air Force fighter pilots, and a group of civilians on their boat, part of the evacuation fleet.

                        In a twilight world of international espionage, an unnamed CIA operative, known as The Protagonist, is recruited by a mysterious organization called Tenet to participate in a global assignment that unfolds beyond real time.
                        The mission: prevent Andrei Sator, a renegade Russian oligarch with precognitive abilities, from starting World War III.
                        The Protagonist will soon master the art of "time inversion" as a way of countering the threat that is to come.

                        We see his life from university days all the way to post-WW2, where his fame saw him embroiled in political machinations.
